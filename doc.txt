Here is the documentation of the code in a text format:

Registeration Script

This script handles user registration by validating input data and storing it in a file.

Functionality

The script allows cross-origin requests by setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to *.
It starts a new session using the session_start() function.
The script checks if the request method is POST. If it is, it proceeds to validate the input data.
The script validates the input data by checking if any of the fields are empty. If any field is empty, it returns an error message.
It then checks if the email format is valid using the filter_var() function. If the email format is invalid, it returns an error message.
The script checks if the password meets the requirements (at least 8 characters long, contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character). If the password does not meet the requirements, it returns an error message.
It then checks if the passwords match. If they do not match, it returns an error message.
If all the validation checks pass, the script hashes the number using the md5() function and creates an array of the posted data.
The script writes the data to a file named data.txt in JSON format.
Finally, it returns a success message indicating that the registration was successful.
